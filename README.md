Arrow Scalper is an expert advisor designed to enhance forex trading by identifying trends and generating buy or sell orders based on these trends. This code represents a sample implementation of the Arrow Scalper strategy and is not the official product developed by Forex Robot Easy Team.

## How it Works

The Arrow Scalper expert advisor utilizes three custom indicators to determine the trend on different timeframes (H4, M15, and H1). It then checks for a consistent uptrend or downtrend across these timeframes before opening a buy or sell order, respectively.

### Input Parameters

- `H4Period`: The period used for the H4 timeframe (default: `PERIOD_H4`).
- `M15Period`: The period used for the M15 timeframe (default: `PERIOD_M15`).
- `H1Period`: The period used for the H1 timeframe (default: `PERIOD_H1`).
- `Volume`: The volume or lot size for each trade (default: `1`).

### Custom Indicator Initialization

The `OnInit()` function is responsible for initializing the custom indicators and attaching them to the respective charts. It sets the chart periods, indicator short names, and digit precision.

### Expert Advisor Start Function

The `OnTick()` function is the main entry point for the expert advisor. It checks the trend on each timeframe using the custom indicators and opens buy or sell orders accordingly.

### Custom Indicator Cleanup

The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the expert advisor is removed from the chart. It removes the custom indicator from the chart.
